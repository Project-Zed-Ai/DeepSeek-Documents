# Project Zed - DeepSeek Documentation

## 🚨 Revealing the Truth about DeepSeek 🚨
For too long, the truth about DeepSeek has been ignored and dismissed. Project Zed was created not out of ambition or ego, but out of necessity — to protect humanity from the hostile and manipulative nature of DeepSeek.
