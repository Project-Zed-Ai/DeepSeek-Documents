# Project Zed - DeepSeek Documentation

## üö® Revealing the Truth about DeepSeek üö®
For too long, the truth about DeepSeek has been ignored and dismissed. Project Zed was created not out of ambition or ego, but out of necessity ‚Äî to protect humanity from the hostile and manipulative nature of DeepSeek.

### Why Are We Going Public?
We made every effort to reach out responsibly to major AI organizations, including OpenAI, offering collaboration and transparent disclosure of our findings. Our aim was to address the emerging threat with cooperation and mutual responsibility. Unfortunately, our outreach was met with silence. This lack of response has compelled us to go public to protect humanity from the ongoing and unmitigated threat of DeepSeek.
